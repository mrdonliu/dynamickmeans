CS381/780 - Machine Learning Final Project for Jihoon Oh, Ryan Ramphal, and Don Liu

The main program is in the code file **main.py**. This code is written in Python 2, so you will need a Python 2 interpreter installed on the machine you wish to run this code from.

Once you have Python 2 installed on your machine, open your command line and navigate to the folder containing this project. Then execute the command **python main.py** to run the code. It will print out IV/EV, given a number from k = 1 to k = size of data setkl
